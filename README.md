# UX
## Aim
The aim of this is create a website that the business can sell their nail products through. This must be easy to use and easy to navigate through on both the vistor and the business side. The visitor must be able to purchase products easily and the business must be able to upload new products on to the website.

* There must be a clear navigation linking all pages together.
* Admin must be able to access both the main website and the admin page.


## Research
Before creating the website, I looked at other companies that sell the same products. Including Barry M, Boots, ASOS, Next and Etsy. I looked at what they featured on the website and I looked at what they all had in common as well as what worked well. The research I do on this, will effect what I feature on the website pages.

* Information of the business displayed so vistors can view it.
* Contact details must be displayed so the vistors can find it if needed.

## Design Choices 
### Overall
The overall design layout of the website has to have a simple layout with elements of pirates to show that these products have been inspired by them and have a stylish presentation for the beauty cosemetic presentation. With a lot of websites looking modern, I will need to feature things that have elements of the pirates style with modern features to them.

### Fonts
The font I have decided to use three font styles. Two are for the headers and the third is for text such as paragraphs. The two I chose for as headers are handwritting styles and they would bring the element of the pirate theme to the text. 
* Font 1 (Meddon) - This font is chose for h1 tags for the title of the website and also the titles of the products. 
* Font 2 (Tangerine) - This font is use for titles that are h2 and any sub titles.
* Font 3 (Forum) - This font is for any paragraphs and anything that I don't want the user or site owner to miss read.
