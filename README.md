# UX
## Aim
The aim of this is create a website that the business can sell their nail products through. This must be easy to use and easy to navigate through on both the vistor and the business side. The visitor must be able to purchase products easily and the business must be able to upload new products on to the website.
### Target Audience
The target audience for the brand Nail Deck are:
* Anyone who love nail polishes.
* Anyone who love pirates.
* Anyone who love hand made products.

### Visitor Goals
* Browse through a list of nail products.
* Find a nail polish they would like to purchase.
* Able to navigate through the website easily.

### Online Shop Goals
* A clear and easy to use website that anyone can use it.
* Linking elements should link to the correct locations.
* The website should work on all size devices (sm, md, lg). This includes the navigation and the features,
* There must be a clear navigation linking all pages together.
* Admin must be able to access both the main website and the admin page.

## Scope
Research was the biggest thing for this website as this is going to be in competition with other shops. I looked at what other competition had and what they haven't got. The research I do on this, will effect what I feature on the website pages.

### Research
I put together pros and cons to a select group of companies that sell the same products. These companies are Barry M, Boots, ASOS, Next and Etsy.

#### [Barry M](https://barrym.com/)
* Pros 
    * A lot of details of the products on display
    * Add to cart button on the product image

* Cons 
    * A lot of features, possibly too many.

## Strategy
## Structure
## Skeleton
## Surface
The surface of the website has to be fit in with the theme and with what would appeal to the target audience. I started to think about the layout, the colours, the typology and the imagery used throughout (see the [Design Choices](https://github.com/katerinaelsasser/NailDeck#design-choices) for full details of what things I decided to present for the surface). Mockups and a flowchart was created to help create all the pages, in all the mockups I noticed that the layouts were simple so customers can understand and have ease to find pages. The images that are used are images of the products the company sells and the products in use as this is advertising for the company and the customers can see what the products look like.

## Design Choices 
### Overall
The overall design layout of the website has to have a simple layout with elements of pirates to show that these products have been inspired by them and have a stylish presentation for the beauty cosemetic presentation. With a lot of websites looking modern, I will need to feature things that have elements of the pirates style with modern features to them.

### Fonts
The font I have decided to use two font styles. These fonts are for the headers, with these they would bring the element of the pirate theme to the text as they are handwriting and it would give the effect of a treasure map. 
* Font 1 (Meddon) - This font is chose for h1 tags for the title of the website and also the titles of the products. 
* Font 2 (Tangerine) - This font is use for titles that are h2 and any sub titles.
### Icons
I wanted to style the website with icons. The icons I wanted to feature must include some pirate themed icons, such as skull and cross bones.
* The for the log in icon on the navbar has two icons. One for then the user is not logged in (which is the skull) and the other for when they are logged in (which is the skull and cross bones).
### Colours

* White - #FFFFFF
* Orange - #FF7D45
* Red - #C63232
* Purple - #772953
* Black - #000000

### Images
The images that have been displayed on the website are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) & [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/). These are royalty free image website. The images that I have used are images of hands with nail varnish on the nails. I have tried to find images of people who are located at beaches or somewhere tropical in the image. These images would be help create the visual of the pirate theme while advertising the products.
